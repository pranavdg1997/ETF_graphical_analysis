# ETF_graphical_analysis

This repository is dedicated to a project on Exchange Traded Funds(ETF) analysis from a Network Science perspective, while utilizing some classicial, some Machine Learning concepts, and studying the results in an interactive dashboard. An exchange traded fund (ETF) is a type of security that tracks  an  index,  sector,  commodity,  or  other  asset,  but which can be purchased or sold on a stock exchange the same  as  a  regular  stock. You can read more about the entire project [here]()\
